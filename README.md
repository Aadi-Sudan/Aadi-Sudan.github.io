## Experience

- **Research Intern – SCU HCI Lab** (Dec. 2024 – Present)  
  - Applied data cleaning and feature engineering techniques to analyze the distribution of gender and race across 40+ occupations each with 10k+ generated personas, reinforcing robust statistical modeling insights into generative AI bias
  - Created and implemented a data pipeline to batch-generate 400k+ personas from ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Deepseek, saving over 150 hours of manpower and generation efficiency and reducing data gathering costs by over 40%
  - Created analysis pipeline to automate data cleaning and produce 5+ graphs for each occupation, translating complex data sets into clear visualizations. Visualizations include logistic regression, double-bar charts, and over-under comparisons to official BLS data, as well as wordclouds for name repetition

- **AI Engineer - Valverus** (Nov. 2024 – Present)
  - About the company: Valverus is a consulting startup in San Jose, CA that targets private equity firms with AI-informed insights into future investments
  - Engineered and Dockerized a RAG agent incorporating Ollama’s LLM and vector embeddings to generate actionable insights for external industry investments, creating 1200-character clusters for model training
  - Developed web scraper using DuckDuckGo Search library, Beautiful Soup, and ArXiv API to scrape 100+ articles and research papers weekly on external industries for providing RAG agent with textual data  

- **Workshop Coordinator – SCU AI Collaborate** (Oct. 2024 – Present)
  - Organized logistics for a hackathon in conjuncture with Adobe Express attended by 100+ participants and 10+ professional judges and officials from Adobe

## Projects

- **CraveQuest (Ongoing)**
  - **Stack:** Flask, Flutter, Firebase Admin SDK, RESTful API, PyTorch, NumPy/Pandas, TorchVision
  - Designing a multi-platform Flutter app that allows users to swipe left or right on restaurants and recieve recommendations for where to dine
  - Implemented a scalable authentication and session management system using Flask, Google Firebase, and RESTful APIs, enabling secure user registration, login, and persistent session tracking across distributed clients
  - Optimized database schema and queries in Firestore by separating users and sessions collections with partitioned keys for user and session ID, reducing lookup latency by 40%
  - Built secure password handling and credential validation pipelines with real-time Firestore queries and tokenized session IDs, preventing duplicate sessions and improving system reliability
  - Incorporated Google Maps API to allow users to see their liked restaurants on a map relative to their current location
  - Designed a CNN to classify images of food uploaded by users and recommend restaurants that might serve those dishes. CNN achieved a validation accuracy of 0.89 using Adam optimizer and cosine similarity
  - Project [repository](https://github.com/mikewen8/Food_app)

- **Biomedical TinyLlama**
  - **Stack:** 
  - Fine-tuned open-source TinyLlama 1.1B model with LoRA, PEFT, and Bitsandbytes on a biomedical instruction-response dataset for clinical text generation
  - Achieved ROUGE-Lsum score of 0.24 and BERT F1 score of 0.89, demonstrating accurate medical understanding and coherent, systemic text generation
  - Implemented FastAPI backend and HTML/CSS/JS frontend to utilize fine-tuned model as a chatbot, offering real-time responses to user queries

- **Data Warehouse**
  - **Stack:** PostgreSQL
  - Designed and implemented a 3-tier data warehouse using PostgreSQL for end-to-end ETL and analytics
  - Built a star schema with fact and dimension tables to support efficient BI querying and reporting
  - Cleaned, transformed, and modeled raw CSV data to generate insights on sales, customers, and product trends
