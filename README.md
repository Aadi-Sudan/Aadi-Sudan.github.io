## Experience

- **Research Intern – SCU HCI Lab** (Dec. 2024 – Present)  
  • Applied data cleaning and feature engineering techniques to analyze the distribution of gender and race across 40+ occupations each with 10k+ generated personas, reinforcing robust statistical modeling insights into generative AI bias
  • Created and implemented a data pipeline to batch-generate 400k+ personas from ChatGPT, Gemini, Mistral, and Deepseek, saving over 150 hours of manpower and generation efficiency and reducing data gathering costs by over 40%
  • Created analysis pipeline to automate data cleaning and produce 5+ graphs for each occupation, translating complex data sets into clear visualizations. Visualizations include logistic regression, double-bar charts, and over-under comparisons to official BLS data, as well as wordclouds for name repetition
  • Contributions can be found at project [repository](https://github.com/scuhci/genai-bias)

- **AI Engineer - Valverus** (Nov. 2024 – Present)  
  • Engineered and Dockerized a RAG agent incorporating Ollama’s LLM and vector embeddings to generate actionable insights for external industry investments, creating 1200-character clusters for model training
  • Developed web scraper using DuckDuckGo Search library, Beautiful Soup, and ArXiv API to scrape 100+ articles and research papers weekly on external industries for providing RAG agent with textual data  

- **Workshop Coordinator – SCU AI Collaborate** (Oct. 2024 – Present)  
  • Organized logistics for a hackathon in conjuncture with Adobe Express attended by 100+ participants and 10+ professional judges and officials from Adobe
  • Preparing interactive presentations for club workshops attended weekly by 50+ people
  • Leading guest speaker events consisting of lectures covering topics such as Agentic AI, AI in business, and more
  • Information on club events can be found at club [website](https://www.scuaiclub.com)

## Projects

- Food Recommendation App (Ongoing)
**Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Flask/FastAPI, Flutter, NumPy/Pandas, TorchVision, (Food-101 to start), cosine similarity  
**What it is:** Users upload a food photo → a **CNN** predicts the **food category** and **sensory attributes** (e.g., spicy/crispy) → the app recommends **similar restaurants/dishes** using embedding similarity.

**Highlights**
- Built an image-upload flow (Flutter → Python backend) with secure file handling and batched inference.
- Started with a **custom CNN** trained on **Food-101**; designing a **multi-head classifier** for both category and texture attributes.
- Created a similarity pipeline: extract penultimate-layer embeddings → compute **cosine similarity** against a restaurant/dish index → return top-k recommendations.
- Modularized data loaders, augmentations, and training loops for reproducibility.

**Impact / Next Steps**
- Moves beyond static menus to **visual food discovery**.
- Roadmap: add **multi-label attributes**, collect **own dataset**, integrate **restaurant APIs**, and A/B test recs vs. popularity baselines.
