## Projects

- Food Recommendation App (Ongoing)
**Stack:** Python, PyTorch, Flask/FastAPI, Flutter, NumPy/Pandas, TorchVision, (Food-101 to start), cosine similarity  
**What it is:** Users upload a food photo → a **CNN** predicts the **food category** and **sensory attributes** (e.g., spicy/crispy) → the app recommends **similar restaurants/dishes** using embedding similarity.

**Highlights**
- Built an image-upload flow (Flutter → Python backend) with secure file handling and batched inference.
- Started with a **custom CNN** trained on **Food-101**; designing a **multi-head classifier** for both category and texture attributes.
- Created a similarity pipeline: extract penultimate-layer embeddings → compute **cosine similarity** against a restaurant/dish index → return top-k recommendations.
- Modularized data loaders, augmentations, and training loops for reproducibility.

**Impact / Next Steps**
- Moves beyond static menus to **visual food discovery**.
- Roadmap: add **multi-label attributes**, collect **own dataset**, integrate **restaurant APIs**, and A/B test recs vs. popularity baselines.
